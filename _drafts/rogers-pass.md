What do you do when you don't want to go back to work after spending the last seven months traveling? Well, for me, you use your brother's upcoming Ski Guide Exam in Canada as an excuse to head north, and get in some spring skiing. With the exam as our cover, Brent and I headed north for a week of skiing on Rogers Pass before his exam.

After nearly 22 hours of driving, we pulled into Golden, BC, grabbed a room, and started planning our tour for the next day. Given the recent 10 cm of snow, we decided to head up to Balu Peak, and get some nice north facing pow turns in.

## Balu Peak
<ul style='list-style-type:none'>
	<li><em>Parking lot elevation:</em> 1,305 m (4,280 ft)</li>
	<li><em>Summit elevation:</em> 2,686 m (8,810 ft)</li>
	<li><em>Total elevation gain:</em> 1,800 m (5,904 ft)</li>
	<li><em>Total time:</em> 8-9 hours</li>
</ul>

Getting to Balu Peak was relatively straight forward. We headed up the Connaught Creek drainage until you could see the mountain, then veered right to catch the saddle between Balu and Video Peak. At that point, we traversed across a glacier and continued our skin up the N/NW face of Balu. The recent snow left us with some excellent pow turns down Balu, but as we continued down the glacier the snow warmed up. After about 1,200' of skiing, we skinned back up to the Balu/Video saddle, and skied back to the car via the same route we climbed. If I was in better shape, we could have added in a decent off the shoulder of Cheops Mountain that surely would have provided even more glorious pow. Instead, we ran practiced locating a buried transceiver-- I have some work to do before I can meet the standard Brent had to meet: locating three burials in 7 minutes.

## Crevasse Rescue Practice

After exhausting me on day one, and looking at the weather forecast, we decided a mellow day practicing crevasse rescue was in order. We had a casual start, headed up the pass, and found a rock to throw me off of so Brent could practice catching me and pulling me up. After that and some lessons for me on what to do if Brent was the one that falls in, we packed up, and headed back to Golden to gameplan for the next day. 

__A side note about the Rogers Pass backcountry skiing rules:__ Because there are over 140 active slide paths that cross the trans Canadian Highway 1, you must get a ski permit from the Glacier National Park Rangers for the area you are going to ski so they know you are skiing in relatively safe areas, and know where people are so they can blast away at the mountains. However, we did not realize that you can only obtain permits the morning of the day you leave. This was a pain since the ranger's station does not open until 7:30 am. While that is plenty early in the winter, given the high temperatures we were seeing, we needed to be on the trail much earlier than that. Mt. Belu did not require such a permit, so we were able to leave bright and early, but some of the other areas we wanted to ski did require these permits. Lucky for us, on April 15, they suspended "winter operations", which meant we no longer needed a permit for any of the areas. Yay for us! On to Avalanche Mountain we go!

## Avalanche Mountain

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
	<li><em>Parking lot elevation:</em> 1,330 m (4,362 ft)</li>
	<li><em>Summit elevation:</em> almost 2,861 m (9,384 ft)</li>
	<li><em>Total elevation gain:</em> 1,850 m (6,068 ft)</li>
	<li><em>Total time:</em> 9:10 hours</li>
</ul>

Skiing Avalanche Mountain may have been the best ski day of the trip. It involved nearly 6,100' of climbing (and skiing), some cramponing up a steep, rocky headwall, glacier travel, and a couloir climb to a gnarly summit (almost). When we started out, we were not entirely sure if we would be skiing the NW couloir or the east face of Avalanche, but we had plans for either. The day went something like this:

1. Leave car at 5:50 am. Hike 3,400' up to the first ridge; start out skinning, add ski crampons after about 1,000', switch to crampons and ice axe after about 2,000'.
2. Top out on NRC col. We could see most of the remaining route from here. The NW couloir of Avalanche looked enticing. Rip skins, and ski four turns down into the North Glacier.
3. Skins back on. Make a a hasty ascent of the next 300-400' as there was a nasty cornice above us.
4. Clear the cornice, slow the pace a bit, and continue on up the North Glacier until the shoulder so we could check out the NW couloir. After digging a pit, we decided the couloir was good to go.
5. Skis back on our back and crampons on, we ascend the final 600' of the couloir.
6. Got to the top about 12:30 pm. Talk through the options: ski the east face, ski the top portion of the couloir, ski the entire couloir, climb the remaining 20-30' to the summit. While it would have been great to ski the entire couloir, the full route descends another 600'before entering a west-southwest facing apron/valley. This didn't look that appealing to us and we new some of the lower down trees on this aspect were snow free. So, we decided to put the skis back on there, and descend the portion of the couloir we climbed. The descent was ass puckering steep.
7. Pow turns in the North Glacier.
8. Skins back on, to gain the ridge and a small peak to get some bonus turns.
9. Pow turns down a very nice wide open slope.
10. Back under the scary cornice, but this time heading down hill, so less scary.
11. Boot pack back to the NRC col.
12. Traverse through snow covered talus until we could get our skis back on.
13. Descend 3,200' back to the car. The col was west facing, and didn't warm much up high, but after the first 500' the snow was nice. Luckily it didn't warm enough to be really tough skiing either.
14. Back to the car by 3:00 pm. 
15. Drink celebratory beers.

## The Asulkan Hut Trip

After a nice rest/prep day, we booked the Asulkan hut for the next two nights, so we could start our days off from higher up. 

### Getting to the Hut: Illecillewaet Glacier to Youngs Peak

<ul style='list-style-type:none'>
	<li><em>Parking lot elevation:</em> 1,202 m (3,942 ft)</li>
	<li><em>Summit elevation:</em> 2,815 m (9,233 ft)</li>
	<li><em>Total elevation gain:</em> 1,740 m (5,707 ft)</li>
	<li><em>Total time:</em> 6:40 hours</li>
</ul>

To get to the hut, we decided to head around and drop in from above, rather than taking the standard approach. For this tour, we headed up the Illecillewaet Glacier, and to Youngs Peak via the Youngs Traverse. From there, we skied 7 Steps of Paradise to the hut. All told, it was 12.4 km and 5,707' of climbing with about 2,350' of skiing. It was a beautiful day, and temps were very warm; this would mark the second of at least four days that it did not freeze at night. The hut was cozy, and would have been a bit crowded with 12 people. Luckily, there were only 6 of us there the first night, and 9 of us there the second night. 

### Jupiter Traverse

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
	<li><em>Hut elevation:</em> 2,100 m (6,888 ft)</li>
	<li><em>Summit elevation:</em> 2,786 m(9,138 ft)</li>
	<li><em>Total elevation gain:</em> a little more than 686 m (2,250 ft)</li>
	<li><em>Total time:</em> 5 hours</li>
</ul>

The Jupiter Traverse was an exciting ski mountaineering objective. The traverse of Mount Jupiter includes traversing its three sub-peaks: Leda, Pollux, and Castor. To get to Castor from the hut, we headed up the western edge of the Asulkan Glacier to the Saphire Col. It is a bootpack to summit Castor from the col. The descent of Castor required some exposed walking, but the ascent of Pollux is where things get a little more serious. We roped up to help protect the few exposed rock moves we had to make headed up Pollux, and I was pretty thankful I was on rope and not free climbing. From the summit of Pollux, we traversed a bit, before coming to an existing sling to rappel off. After the rappel, and more downclimbing through snow, we made the final, less exposed ascent of Leda. 

From Leda, we put our skis back on and headed for a small sub-peak for our descent back to the hut. The standard descent goes to the lookers right of this peak, but faces almost due east. With the warm temperatures we were experiencing, we decided to head off the more northerly facing sub-peak. This choice led to better snow, and a much more interesting descent. From the bottom of that shot, we had a little more skiing, and a lot of traversing to get back to the hut. 

Even after stopping to admire our line for a while, we were back to the hut by 11:30, where we napped, played cards, and practiced more crevasse rescue for the remainder of the day.

### Back to the Car Already

We intended to ski the Forever Young Couloir on our way out. However, there had not been a freeze for the past four nights, and several other guys at the hut reported that the cornice was falling into the couloir the previous day. So we decided it was best to just pack up, and get back to the car before the snow turned even more disgusting. 

We had some great skiing both at the Asulkan Hut and on our other days, but it also allowed us to preview the area for an inevitable return. We saw so much incredible terrain that would be fantastic earlier in the season, and I need to ski some classic Revy pillow lines!
