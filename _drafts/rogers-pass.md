# Mt. Belu

# Crevas Rescue Practice

# Avalanche Mountain

- Parking lot elevation:
- Summit elevation:
- Total time:

1. Left the car at 5:50 am. Hike ~3,000' up to the first ridge; started skinning, added ski crampons after about 1,000', but after about 2,000' had to transition to crampons
2. Topped out on XXX col. We could see most of the remaining route from here. The NW couloir of Avalance looked inticing. Ripped skins, and skied 4 turns down into the North Glacier.
3. Skins back on, and made a hasty ascent of the next 300-400' as there was a nasty cornice above us.
4. We cleared the cornice, so our pace slowed a bit, and we continued on up the North Glacier until the shoulder so we could enter the NW couloir. 
5. Skis back on our back and crampons on, we ascended the final 600'(?) of the couloir.
6. Got to the top about 12:30 pm. Did not summit, but put our skis back on and descended the NW couloir. Ass puckering steap. The full route descends another 600 or so ' before entering an East? facing apron/valley. This didn't look that appealing to us, so we ducked back into the North Glacier, following our ascent route.
7. Pow turns in the North Glacier.
8. Skins back on, to gain the ridge and a small peak to get some bonus turns.
9. Pow turns down a very nice wide open slope.
10. Back under the scary cornice, but this time heading down hill, so less scary.
11. Boot pack back to the ridge.
12. Traverse through snow covered talus until we could get our skis back on.
13. Descend about 2,800' back to the car. The col was west facing, and didn't warm much up high, but after the first 500' the snow was nice. Luckily it didn't warm enough to be really tough skiing either.
14. Back to the car by 3:00 pm. After ~6,300' hiking and skiing.
