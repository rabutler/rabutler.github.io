What do you do when you don't want to go back to work after spending the last seven months traveling? Well, for me, you use your brother's upcoming Ski Guide Exam in Canada as an excuse to head north, and get in some spring skiing. With the exam as our cover, Brent and I headed north for a week of skiing on Rogers Pass before his exam.

After nearly 22 hours of driving, we pulled into Golden, BC, grabbed a room, and started planning our tour for the next day. Given the recent snow, we decided to head up to Balu, and get some nice north facing pow turns in.

# Balu Peak
- Parking lot elevation: 1,305 m (4,280 ft)
- Summit elevation: 2,686 m (8,810 ft)
- Total elevation gain: 1,800 m (5,904 ft)
- Total time: 8-9 hours

Getting to Balu Peak was relatively straight foward. We headed up the Connaught Creek drainage until you could see the mountain, then veered right to catch the saddle between Balu and Video Peak. At that point, we traversed accross a glacier and continued our skin up the N/NW face of Balu. The recent snow left us with some excellent pow turns down Balu, but as we continued down the glacier the snow warmed up. After about 1,200' of skiing, we skinned back up to the Balu/Video saddle, and skied back to the car via the same route we climbed. Had I been in better shape, we could have added in a decent off the shoulder of Cheops Mountain. Instead, we did a beacon search practice. 

# Crevas Rescue Practice

After exhausting me on day one, and looking at the weather forecast, we decided a mellow day practicing crevas rescue was in order. We had a casual start, headed up the pass, and found a rock to throw me off of, so Brent could practice catching me and pulling me up. After some lessons for me of what to do if Brent was the one that falls in, we packed up, and headed back to Golden to gameplan for the next day. 

__A side note about the Rogers Pass backcountry skiing rules:__ To ski many areas of Rogers Pass in the winter, you have to get a ski permit from the Glacier National Park Rangers for the area you are going to ski. This is reasonable as there are over 140 active slide paths that cross the highway (trans Canadian highway 1) or the Canadian Pacific Railroad over Rogers Pass and they want to make sure you are skiing in relatively safe areas, and know where people are so they can blast away at the mountain. However, we did not realize that you could only obtain the permits in the morning of the day you leave. This was a pain since the ranger's station does not open until 7:30 am. While that is plenty early enough in the winter, given the high temperatures we were seeing, we needed to be on the trail much earlier than that. Mt. Belu did not require such a permit, so we were able to leave bright and early, but some of the other areas we wanted to ski did require these permits. Lucky for us, on April 15, they suspended "winter operations", which meant we no longer needed a permit for any of the areas. Yay for us! On to Avalanche Mountain we go!

# Avalanche Mountain

- Parking lot elevation: 1,330 m (4,362 ft)
- Summit elevation: almost 2,861 m (9,384 ft)
- Total elevation gain: 1,850 m (6,068 ft)
- Total time: 9:10 hours

Skiing Avalance Mountain may have been the best ski day of the trip. It involved nearly 6,100' of climbing (and skiing), some cramponing up a steap, rocky headwall, glacier travel, and a couloir climb to a mountain summit (almost). The day went something like this:

1. Left the car at 5:50 am. Hike 3,400' up to the first ridge; started skinning, added ski crampons after about 1,000', but after about 2,000' had to transition to crampons
2. Topped out on NRC col. We could see most of the remaining route from here. The NW couloir of Avalance looked inticing. Ripped skins, and skied 4 turns down into the North Glacier.
3. Skins back on, and made a hasty ascent of the next 300-400' as there was a nasty cornice above us.
4. We cleared the cornice, so our pace slowed a bit, and we continued on up the North Glacier until the shoulder so we could enter the NW couloir. 
5. Skis back on our back and crampons on, we ascended the final 600' of the couloir.
6. Got to the top about 12:30 pm. Did not quite summit, but put our skis back on and descended the NW couloir. Ass puckering steap. The full route descends another 600 or so ' before entering a west-southwest facing apron/valley. This didn't look that appealing to us and we new some of the lower down trees on this aspect were snow free. So, we ducked back into the North Glacier, following our ascent route.
7. Pow turns in the North Glacier.
8. Skins back on, to gain the ridge and a small peak to get some bonus turns.
9. Pow turns down a very nice wide open slope.
10. Back under the scary cornice, but this time heading down hill, so less scary.
11. Boot pack back to the ridge.
12. Traverse through snow covered talus until we could get our skis back on.
13. Descend 3,200' back to the car. The col was west facing, and didn't warm much up high, but after the first 500' the snow was nice. Luckily it didn't warm enough to be really tough skiing either.
14. Back to the car by 3:00 pm. 

# The Asulkan Hut Trip

After a nice rest/prep day, we booked the Asulkan hut for the next two nights, so we could (hopefully) start our days off from higher up. 

## Getting to the Hut: Illawecit? Glacier to Youngs Peak

- Parking lot elevation: 1,202 m (3,942 ft)
- Summit elevation: 2,815 m (9,233 ft)
- Total elevation gain: 1,740 m (5,707 ft)
- Total time: 6:40 hours 

To get to the hut, we decided to head around and drop in from above, rather than taking the standard approach. For this tour, we headed up the Illecillewaet Glacier, up to the Youngs Traverse and to Youngs Peak. From there, we skied down 2,345' 7 Steps to the hut. All told, it was 12.4 km and 1740 m of climbing with 2,345' of skiing to the hut. The temps were very warm, and it was a beautiful day. The hut was cozy, and would have been a bit crowded with 12 people. Luckily, there were only 6 of us there the first night, and 9 of us there the second night. 

## Jupiter Traverse

- Hut elevation: 2,100 m (6,888 ft)
- Summit elevation: 2,786 m(9,138 ft)
- Total elevation gain: a little more than 686 m (2,250 ft)
- Total time: 5 hours

The Jupiter Traverse was an exciting ski mountaineering objective. The traverse of Mount Jupiter includes traversing its three subpeaks: Leda, Pollux, and Castor. To get to Castor, we headed up the western edge of the Asulkan Glacier from the hut, to the Saphire Col. It is a bootpack to summit Castor. The descent of Castor required some exposed walking, but the ascent of Pollux is where things get a little more serious. We roped up to help protect the few exposed rock moves we had to make headed up Pollux, and I was pretty thankful I was on rope and not free climbing. From the summit, we traversed a bit, before coming to an existing sling to rapel off. After the rapel, and more downclimbing through snow, we made the final, less exposed ascent of Leda. 

From Leda, we put this skis back on and headed for a small sub-peak for our descent back to the hut. The standard descent goes to the lookers right of this peak, but faced almost due east. With the warm temperatures we were experiencing, we decided to head off the more northerly facing sub-peak. This choice led to better snow, and a much more interesting descent. From the bottom of that shot, we had a little more skiing, and a lot of traversing to get back to the hut. 

Even after stopping to admire our line for quite a while, we were back to the hut by 11:30, where we napped, played cards, and practiced more crevas rescue for the remainder of the day.

## Back to the Car Already

We intended to ski the Forever Young Couloir on our way out. However, it there had not been a freeze for the past 4 nights, and several of the other guys at the hut reported that the cornice was falling into the couloir the previous day. So we decided it was best to just pack up, and get back to the car before the snow turned even more disgusting. 

But, I will definitely be back to Rogers Pass and the Asulkan Hut sometime. It's incredible, and I need to ski some classic Revy pillow lines!
