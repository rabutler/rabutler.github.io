Right now, I am:

- Traveling through Mexico and Central America; living in Nicaragua (a sabbatical of sorts).
- Focused on:
  - Creating new good habits, losing some bad habits, and tracking my progress using [HabitBull][1].
  - Creating a healthy body and mind, through nutrition, working out, and meditation, so that I can [live to be 213 years old][2].
  - Creating, not consuming.
- Working on:
  - Getting this website/blog up and running.
  - Being ["so good they cannot ignore me"][3].
- Inspired by:
  - Great surfers.
  - Peter Diamandis.
  - [Lazy: A Manifesto.][4]
- Enjoying:
  - Surfing.
  - Isaac Asimov's short stories. They seem relevant to some modern debates on artificial intelligence. 
  - Not being "busy".
