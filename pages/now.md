Right now, I am:

- Making sure I read at least one terrifying article about the Trump administration each day. 
- Focused on:
  - Creating new good habits, losing some bad habits, and tracking my progress using [HabitBull][1].
  - Creating a healthy body and mind, through nutrition, working out, and meditation, so that I can [live to be 213 years old][2].
  - Creating, not consuming
- Working on:
  - Making more frequent posts
  - Committing to a single side project, even if it isn't the perfect side project
  - Being ["so good they cannot ignore me"][3]
- Inspired by:
  - Peter Diamandis
  - [Lazy: A Manifesto.][4]
- Enjoying:
  - Ski season
