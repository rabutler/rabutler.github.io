The site logo says it all. I am a Boulder, Colorado based skiing, traveler, who likes writing code, mostly in R, that works as an engineer. I anticipate that I'll use this website as a place to show off some of my rad R skills and brag about some of my awesome trips. 

I graduated from the University of Colorado-Boulder in 2011 with a BS and MS in Civil Engineering with a concentration in water resources. Since then, I have worked for the Bureau of Reclamation, building, and running deterministic and statistical water resource management models. 

I enjoy traveling, skiing, rock climbing, and now, surfing. Most of my trips involve going somewhere to do one of those activities.

I also enjoy programming. While I enjoy solving any problem I can with a computer's assistance, I focus on automating manual processes and creating compelling visualisations of (mostly water related) data. In most cases, I utilize R to solve the problems and create the visualisations, as I have been using it extensively for the previous six years.

I often think, and dream, about future technologies that will make our lives easier. In particular, driverless cars have me extremely excited. The day when I can hop in a car after work and wake up in Jackson Hole, well rested, to 18" of snow, cannot come soon enough. And I'm meditating on what I can do to help that day arrive faster.
