The site logo says it all. I am a skiing, traveler, who likes writing code, mostly in R, and works as an engineer. I also value brevity, though I tend to ramble at times, so do not expect a lot here. I anticipate that I'll use this website as a place to show off some of my rad R skills, brag about some of my awesome trips, and test out different web-based technologies. 

Fortunately, I am on a bit of a sebatical at the moment, and so I am spending some time working on some small projects that interest me. Those will be showcased in the [projects area][1], as I finish them up.
