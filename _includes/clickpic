* Used to include a picture at a decent size for blog post, that will open to full size
* picture when it is clicked on. 
* the include.pic should be a path to the figure 
* IMPORTANT: it is assumed that it is stored in site.imgurl
* include.orientation should either be h for horizontal, or v for vertical. This will determine the 
* relative size of the figure.

<a class= "th" href="{{ site.urlimg }}{{ include.pic }}">
	<img src="{{ site.urlimg }}{{ include.pic }}" 
	width={% if include.orientation == "h" %} "100%" {% else %} "50%" {% endif %}
	height={% if include.orientation == "h" %} "100%" {% else %} "50%" {% endif %}	/>
